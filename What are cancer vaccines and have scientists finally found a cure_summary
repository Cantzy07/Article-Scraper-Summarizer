Sure! Here's a summary of the article:

**Cancer Vaccines**

Cancer vaccines are a form of immunotherapy designed to help the immune system recognise and kill cancer cells, preventing their return. They are tailored to each patient's specific tumor using DNA sequencing or artificial intelligence.

**How they work:**

- Cancer vaccines provide an instruction that prompts the patient's cells to produce an antigen (protein) that identifies cancer cells.
- The immune system recognises and mounts an immune response, attacking the cancer cells.
- Patients with cancer can be protected from the disease if their immune system recognises and eliminates cancer cells.

**Types of cancer they can treat:**

Cancer vaccines are currently being studied for various types of cancer, including colorectal, lung, bladder, pancreas, and kidney cancers.

**Access and availability:**

The Cancer Vaccine Launch Pad in England is the first of its kind worldwide, offering access to thousands of patients with cancer. Patients can join clinical trials through their GP.

**Outcomes and future potential:**

Clinical trials have shown promising results, with some patients experiencing complete remission without further treatment. This breakthrough has significant implications for cancer treatment, potentially making it a more effective and accessible disease-fighting tool.
